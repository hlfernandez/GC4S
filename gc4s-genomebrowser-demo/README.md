The `gc4s-genomebrowser-demo` module
=========================

This module provides an example of usage of the `GenomeBrowser` component. The source code for this example is available at `org.sing_group.gc4s.genomebrowser.demo.GenomeBrowserTest`. The sample data (about 100MB) is downloaded the first time you run the demo in the `target` directory.

[This URL](www.sing-group.org/gc4s/demos) provides web views of the demo classes in this module so that they can be read without the need of downloading the project.
